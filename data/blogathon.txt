THE TIGER THOUGHTFLUENCER PROGRAM 

The Tiger Thoughtfluencer Program (TFL)  is our endeavor towards cultivating a culture of thought leadership, rekindling the passion for ideas and original thinking that have made us at Tiger, who we are.  

We’re looking to build a community of Tiger Experts and Evangelists across levels and interests, people who’ll lead the wave of storytelling around data, bringing numbers and tech to life.  

Navigating through tech trends, serving as an ethical compass when needed, reminding people of the true purpose of AI - the need to create a better working world, and inspiring the data engineering and data science community to constantly do better - these are just some of the stories we want to tell and the influence we want to exert. 

We’ll achieve this by creating a self-sustaining community of authors, writers and influencers and empowering them with the right coaching and training that will include article writing, social media and personal branding. 

In the spirit of this initiative, we're launching a Blogathon Campaign featuring:

- A straightforward blogging competition based on article submissions.
- A writers' workshop to provide beginner writers with fundamental writing skills.
- An esteemed jury determining the top four winners.
- An opportunity for the top 50 participants who submit articles to be part of the Thoughtfluencer program.

Not only are there exciting prizes up to USD 400 for the winner and guaranteed gifts upon registration, but you also get access to a free writing masterclass.
